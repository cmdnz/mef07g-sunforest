The most advanced countries like Germany, France and USA have again a mediocre performance.\nLack of teaching staff: If schools have ‘no’ or ‘a lot of staff missing teaching mathematics’, then their students’ performance in mathematics drops. If schools have a moderate number of missing (‘very little’ and ‘to some extent’) students’ performance in mathematics is not affected much.\nProfessional Development: Does your school offer professional development to mathematics teachers in any of the following? It seems there is no difference in students’ mathematical performance whether their school provides or does not professional development to the teachers.\nIs your school a public or a private school? Answer to this question: In general, the school type does not matter much in students’ performance in PISA 2022.\nSpecifically in Turkey, we checked whether school type mattered in terms of frequency of high achievers: Interestingly, the percentage of high achievers as well as the lowest scorers coming from private schools is higher than public schools."

    "text": "4.1 | PISA 2022 Analysis: A Comprehensive Examination of OECD Countries\n\n4.1.1 | Introduction\n\n\n\nThe Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022, focusing on reading, science, and mathematics proficiency, has provided a wealth of insights into the educational landscape of OECD countries. This analysis seeks to delve into the nuances of the data, examining key takeaways, exploring data preparation processes, and uncovering trends related to teaching staff, professional development, and school type in relation to student performance.\n\n\n4.1.2 | Key Takeaways\nTop Scorers and Surprising Performances\n\nTop Scorers: Notable achievements were observed in Far Eastern countries such as Korea and Japan, along with Eastern European nations like Estonia, Poland, and the Czech Republic.\nSurprising Performances: Finland, renowned for its education model, exhibited a performance that fell below expectations. Similarly, advanced nations like Germany, France, and the USA demonstrated only average results.\n\nTeaching Staff Impact\n\nLack of Teaching Staff: An intriguing observation emerged; schools experiencing either no or excessive shortages in teaching staff witnessed a noticeable drop in mathematics performance. However, schools with moderate shortages showed a comparatively smaller impact.\n\nProfessional Development and School Type\n\nProfessional Development: Surprisingly, there was no discernible difference in student performance based on whether schools provided professional development opportunities to mathematics teachers or not.\nSchool Type: The duality between public and private schools did not significantly influence student performance.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 | Data Preparation\nThe 2022 student and school questionnaire data files from the PISA 2022 database were meticulously processed. Downloaded in .sav format, they were converted to .csv format for ease of analysis in Python. The resulting datasets were then merged based on relevant variables, creating a comprehensive dataset for further exploration in R.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n# library(ggridges)\nlibrary(knitr)\nload(\"pisa.RData\")\npisa &lt;- pisa %&gt;% select(-X)\n\npisa$SUMMATH &lt;- rowSums(pisa[, 5:14], na.rm = TRUE)\npisa$mean_math &lt;- rowMeans(pisa[, 5:14], na.rm = TRUE)\n\npisa$SUMREAD &lt;- rowSums(pisa[, 15:24], na.rm = TRUE)\npisa$mean_read &lt;- rowMeans(pisa[, 15:24], na.rm = TRUE)\n\npisa$SUMSCI &lt;- rowSums(pisa[, 25:34], na.rm = TRUE)\npisa$mean_sci &lt;- rowMeans(pisa[, 25:34], na.rm = TRUE)\n\npisa_mean &lt;- pisa %&gt;% filter(OECD_x == 1) %&gt;% group_by(CNT) %&gt;% summarise(mean_math = mean(mean_math, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                                  mean_read = mean(mean_read, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                                  mean_sci = mean(mean_sci, na.rm = TRUE))\n\npisa_mean_mean &lt;- pisa_mean %&gt;% summarise(mean_mean = mean(mean_math))\nprint(pisa_mean_mean)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_mean\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      426.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 | Graphs and Inferences\nGraph 1: Average Mathematics Score by OECD Countries\n\n\nCode\npisa_mean &lt;- pisa_mean %&gt;% arrange(desc(mean_math))\n\n\nggplot(pisa_mean, aes(x = reorder(CNT, mean_math), y = mean_math)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkblue\") +\n  #highlight the average value\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 425, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title = \"Mean Math Score by OECD Country\",\n       x = \"Country\",\n       y = \"Mean Math Score\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nIntriguingly, mean scores across all three subjects were lower in countries where there was no lack of teaching staff compared to schools with some shortage. However, as anticipated, a severe shortage of teaching staff led to a decline in mean scores.\nGraph 2: Mean Scores by Lack of Teaching Staff\n\n\nCode\n# SC017Q01NA Instruction hindered by: A lack of teaching staff #Not at all # Very little # To some extent # A lot\n#pisa$SC017Q01NA\n# group by SC017Q01NA calculate mean math score , mean read score and mean sci score\npisa_lack_of_teaching_staff &lt;- pisa %&gt;% group_by(SC017Q01NA) %&gt;% summarise(mean_math = mean(mean_math, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                                         mean_read = mean(mean_read, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                                         mean_sci = mean(mean_sci, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n pisa_lack_of_teaching_staff &lt;- pisa_lack_of_teaching_staff %&gt;% filter(!is.na(SC017Q01NA))\n# line plot\npisa_lack_of_teaching_staff %&gt;% gather(key = \"subject\", value = \"score\", mean_math, mean_read, mean_sci) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = SC017Q01NA, y = score, fill = subject)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Math, Reading and Science Score by Lack of Teaching Staff\", x = \"Lack of Teaching Staff\",\n       y = \"Mean Score\") + facet_grid(. ~ subject) + theme_bw() +  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nContrary to expectations, the availability or lack of professional development opportunities did not exhibit a significant impact on student scores, as evidenced by Graph 3.\nGraph 3: Professional Development Impact\n\n\nCode\n#  SC184*** mean math score, mean read score and mean sci score \"Does your school offer professional development to\n# mathematics teachers in any of the following?\n#pisa$SC184Q01JA # 1Yes 2No\n# set 1 as yes and 2 as no\n\npisa_SC184Q01JA &lt;- pisa %&gt;% mutate(SC184Q01JA = ifelse(SC184Q01JA == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n# drp the NA \npisa_SC184Q01JA &lt;- pisa_SC184Q01JA %&gt;% filter(!is.na(SC184Q01JA))\nprofessional_development_to_mathematics_teachers &lt;- pisa_SC184Q01JA %&gt;% group_by(SC184Q01JA) %&gt;% summarise(mean_math = mean(mean_math, na.rm = TRUE))\n# line plot normalize the data\nggplot(professional_development_to_mathematics_teachers, aes(x = SC184Q01JA, y = mean_math)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#F08D81\") +\n    labs(title = \"Mean Math Score by Professional Development to Mathematics Teachers\",\n         x = \"Professional Development to Mathematics Teachers\",\n         y = \"Mean Math Score\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#pisa_SC184Q01JA$SC184Q01JA\n\n\nThe implications of Graph 4 are profound: the overall educational experience and environment play a crucial role in student performance, transcending the influence of professional development opportunities.\nSchool type, whether public or private, did not emerge as a significant factor in determining student achievement.

Six other nations, including Hong Kong (China), Japan, Korea, Macao (China), and Chinese Taipei, also outperformed the OECD average.\nHigh-Performing Students: Approximately 69% of students in OECD countries demonstrated proficiency in mathematics. Notably, 16 out of 81 countries had more than 10% of students attaining Level 5 or 6 proficiency.\n\nStriking Results\n\nTeaching Staff Shortage: The shortage of mathematics teachers emerged as a critical factor significantly affecting student performance. Schools with no or excessive shortages witnessed a substantial decrease in mathematics achievement, emphasizing the need for a balanced teacher supply.\nProfessional Development: Surprisingly, no significant relationship was found between professional development opportunities for mathematics teachers and student achievement. This underscores the necessity for educational institutions to review and enhance their professional development programs.\nSchool Type: The distinction between public and private schools did not show a significant effect on student achievement. This highlights the paramount importance of focusing on other factors, particularly the quality of teaching staff.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 | Math Scores Shiny Dashboard\nHere is the link to a Shiny dashboard where you can select the math results of three different countries based on difficulty levels (level 1a, level 3, level 6) and based on school types (“p” private, “g” public):\nPisa Math Scores\n\n\n4.1.7 | Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this in-depth analysis of PISA 2022 data unveils the intricate dynamics influencing student success.\nAddressing shortages in teaching staff, refining professional development programs, and prioritizing overall educational quality are pivotal strategies for institutions aspiring to elevate student achievements. The findings presented here provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and institutions seeking to enhance the educational experience and outcomes for students in the ever-evolving global landscape.\nFor a detailed exploration, including graphs and additional insights, please refer to the complete analysis."
